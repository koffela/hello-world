# hello-world

Hello everyone!

My name is Aaron and I am an aspiring game developer. I've used github a little, but I could definitely use a review! I am excited to see what the classes in computer science will bring. I work at Clodfelter's on Monroe Avenue, and It would be nice to see you all there!
